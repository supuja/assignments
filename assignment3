Problem statement:
Suppose hash-keys are drawn from the population of all nonnegative integers that are multiples of some constant c, and 
hash function h(x) is x mod 15. For what values of c will h be a suitable hash function, i.e., a large random choice of
hash-keys will be divided roughly equally into buckets? 



Consider the hash function, h(x)=x mod 15. Since h(x) can give only values from 0 to 15, we can have only 15 buckets
numbered from 0,1…...14. We have to choose “c” in such a way that all hash-keys are uniformly distributed into all buckets.
Suppose c is taken as 2, then all the hash-keys will be distributed only in bucket numbered  0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14.Others 
buckets will be all empty. Same is the case with c=3,4…...etc. For a particular “c” only buckets which are multiple of it 
will be chosen always.
If we chose “c” as 1,16,31……………...i.e  one more than multiple of bucketsize(here it is 15) then there is chance of hash-keys 
being divided roughly equally into all buckets.
  
     Consider c as 1, then hash-keys will be 0,1,2,3,4………14.which will be hashed into buckets numbered 0,1,2,3…………….14 
     and again from 15,16…… same thing continues.
