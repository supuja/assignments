keywords. What technique, and why, will you use to serve the request efficiently?

Use of matching options with your keywords to help control which searches can trigger your ad.
  Broad match: Results of the match include misspellings, synonyms, related searches,                         and other relevant variations.
This is the default matching option. With broad match, your ad may show if a search term contains your keyword terms in any order, and possibly along with other terms. Your ads can also show for close variations of your keywords.
Sticking with the broad match default is a great choice if you don't want to spend a lot of time building your keyword lists and want to capture the highest possible volume of ad traffic. You can use it with negative keywords  to avoid highly irrelevant traffic
